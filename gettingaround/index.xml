      <description>General info In Tallinn everything is easy to reach by public transport (buses, trolleys, trams), taxi or ridesharing apps. A tram (line no. 4) is also a good option to get from the airport to the city centre.
The public transport network operates broadly from 6:00 to 23:00 daily (some lines until 24:00, see here). You do not have to show anything to the driver upon entry to the vehicle, but you should validate your pre-purchased ticket at an orange validator, located near the entrance.</description>
